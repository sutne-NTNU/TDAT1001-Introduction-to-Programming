# Introduction to programming

## Course content
Overview over basic object-oriented design og Java-programming. 
Concepts within object-orientation: classes, hieriarki, objects, encapsulation etc. 
Java-syntax: datatypes, conditions, loops, expressions, reading to and from a source, arrays, cooperation between objects, unit-testing, computerfiles and serialization, graphical programming and practical programming of LEGO-robots.

## Learning outcome
